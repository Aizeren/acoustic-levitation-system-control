# Acoustic levitation system control
This project uses Arduino and ultrasonic emitters to levitate small particles in air. Also it uses Qt and serial port to communicate with system and control height of nodes, on which particles is stayed.

# You will need:
1. Arduino Uno
2. At least 2 ultrasonic emitters (e.g. can be extracted from US-015 or HC-SR04)
3. TB6612 Motor Driver or equivalent

# Running
You need to load "ultrasonic_levitation.ino" on your Arduino (the project used Arduino Uno) and connect pins according to the scheme given below:
*here should be scheme*

Connect the Arduino to your computer via USB. Run Qt App. Have Fun!
